### The Surface Plane

#### Design
I wanted to keep the colors minimal as to make it accesible to those with poorer/impaired vision.

##### Background Image
For the background i used a picture of the South African flag.This sets the theme and i feel is very apt and is not in contrast with the font or container housing the quiz as the container is grey and font black so this is great for users with any vision issues.

### Font Used:
  The font family used throughout this site is [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
